11/2/23,15:59,Taha,Hi
11/4/23,15:25,Taha,Hey guys!
I hope you all are doing well. I just wanted to confirm that for the next RCS meeting we are supposed to just present the suitable Optimal Transport functions to use in our project,right? if that's the case,I did some research and landed on two optimal transport functions namely,Sinkhorn,which was used in the research paper that professor provided us,and Greenkhorn. I have also found that we can choose between the two by looking at the data e.g. if the data is noisy,Sinkhorn would be the best choice. There are python libraries already available to implement these functions and other OT functions. 
Here the few confusions I had:
- Do we need to study the implementations of the methods as well provided that there are already python implementations of these? 
- What else can I work on in order to contribute more to the next meeting? 
- Also,I would be happy to hear (only if you wanna share) what you guys are doing so that I don't miss out something for the next RCS meeting :)

11/20/23,19:28,Taha,Hi,
I am good. Thank you!

Yes,I also think it's a good idea. Once we have the text,writing in overleaf won't be a big problem I think.

That's great! I will take a look at the intro. Don't worry we are just starting out

I am good with either. I can also do a bit of both,rewriting and finding quotes in the sources.

Yes,I can start with ML approach. 

I think we can start with dataset and leave out the approach for after the next meeting? Because if I think we are not yet sure about the direction we are taking i.e,either comparing OT and cross entropy or just different OT functions. Also,we don't yet know which OT we are using,right?
